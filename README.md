# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

This project addressed the need to refactor starter code for the website main page of a mock company, Horiseon. The goal of refactoring the website was to consolidate the CSS for clarity and DRY principles, as well as to add accessibility features and increase documentation clarity with the use of semantic HTML, image alt descriptions, and increased efficiency of CSS formatting. The HTML and CSS documents were also re-ordered as needed to match the order of items on the webpage when displayed in the browser. Completing this project was educational regarding how to implement semantic HTML, as well as for how to write more efficient, accessible, and clear documentation with both CSS and HTML. The project also provided a good opportunity to practice the GitHub and Git workflow for committing changes to a remote repository.
